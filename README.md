## Description
Music app is yet another Spotify clone. As the time goes, i felt that Spotify was getting bloated with some non-music related content (Podcasts, Audio-books, etc.) and unrelevant Playlist/Albums ads that are quite intrusive.  
This app is putting the music back in the center of attention with UX/UI considerations so playing music and browsing through playlists, albums and tracks feels nice again!


## Core feature missing for 100% usability
- [ ] Infinite scroll to load more than what Spotify API is limiting
- [ ] Volume slider
- [ ] Queue system (see queue, add to queue, reorder queue)
- [ ] Creating playlists
- [ ] A home page
- [ ] Account details & Refresh token
- [ ] Mobile features that can't be fixed with responsive (eg: big player)


## Getting Started

Create an app on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and get you client_id and secret.  

Rename `.env.exemple` to `.env` and fill your Spotify client_id and secret.  

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
